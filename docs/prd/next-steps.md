# Next Steps

## Architect Prompt

**Architect**, you're now ready to design the technical architecture for Pocket Knife. Please review this PRD and the Project Brief (`docs/brief.md`) to create a comprehensive architecture document.

**Key Focus Areas:**
1. Ruby project structure (lib/ organization, module namespacing)
2. Argument parsing library selection (thor vs OptionParser - document tradeoffs)
3. Numeric validation approach (regex vs Ruby parsing methods)
4. Error handling patterns (custom exception classes vs simple messages)
5. Testing architecture (RSpec structure, test helpers, fixtures)
6. Installation mechanism details (Rake task implementation)
7. Performance considerations (Ruby startup time, optimization strategies)

**Deliverable:** Create `docs/architecture.md` with comprehensive technical specifications following the fullstack-architecture template, adapted for a CLI tool.

**Command to begin:** Load the architect agent and use the `*document-project` task or create architecture from scratch using this PRD as input.
