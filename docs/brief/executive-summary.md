# Executive Summary

Pocket Knife is a comprehensive Ruby CLI toolkit designed to provide quick, reliable calculations and product management directly in the terminal. Built for developers and technical users who need instant mathematical computations and product cataloging without leaving their workflow, the tool offers multiple command-line interfaces including:

- **Core Calculator:** Basic percentage calculations (`calc` command)
- **Natural Language Interface:** LLM-powered conversational calculations (`ask` command)
